# Architecture

This document explains what each component owns and how a simulation moves
through the system. Component READMEs explain how to work on each component.
[`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) explains how to run the services.

## System

```text
Browser
  |
  v
SvelteKit web app
  |-- users, sessions, and simulations in public
  |-- reads current jobs from compute.jobs
  |
  v
FastAPI compute service
  |-- compute.jobs and the rqueue task_queue schema
  |-- worker -> tsdhn engine -> MinIO
```

The browser talks to the web app. The web app checks the session and handles
the researcher-facing flow. Its server code calls the compute API at
`COMPUTE_API_URL` with `COMPUTE_API_TOKEN`. The browser never receives the
token and never calls the compute API directly.

The web app and compute service may use the same PostgreSQL server. Separate
schemas and database roles keep their writes independent.

## Responsibilities

### Web app

The web app owns:

- users, sessions, accounts, and verification records;
- `simulation_id`, user ID, submitted parameters, and creation time;
- failures that happen while submitting a simulation to the compute service;
- authentication, ownership checks, and user-facing responses;
- joining the simulation with current compute state for display.

The web app does not store compute progress, queue state, an internal compute
job ID, a compute-service selector, or output storage keys.

### Compute service

The compute service owns:

- the API used by the web server;
- `compute.jobs` and the `task_queue` schema rqueue owns;
- the internal compute job ID;
- job progress, retry state, and worker heartbeats;
- simulation work directories and checkpoints;
- output metadata and uploads to MinIO.

The compute service receives a `simulation_id` from the web app. It does not
know about web sessions, users, or passwords.

### Simulation engine

The `tsdhn` package owns the scientific calculation, pipeline order, run
directory, checkpoints, and output files. It has no dependency on web users,
PostgreSQL jobs, queues, or MinIO.

The engine preserves several numerical and file-format rules from the original
MATLAB and Fortran programs. Those rules are documented with the engine and
beside the code that implements them. Legacy behavior is compatibility
evidence; it is not treated as scientific validation without a source.

### Output storage

The worker may use local disk while a simulation is running. That work
directory contains intermediate files and checkpoints needed for recovery.

MinIO stores completed output files. The compute database stores their names,
media types, filenames, and private object keys. Public API responses omit the
object keys.

## Database ownership

The database owner runs migrations and owns all schemas and tables. Runtime
services use restricted roles.

The web app creates and writes only its tables in `public`. Its simulation
table contains:

```text
id
user_id
params
submission_error
created_at
```

The compute service creates and writes `compute.jobs` and the `task_queue`
schema rqueue owns. `compute.jobs.simulation_id` links a compute job to the web
simulation. The value is unique because repeating a submission must return the
same compute job.

The web runtime role can read and write the web tables and read
`compute.jobs`. It cannot change compute jobs, read queue tables, or run schema
changes. The table definition in `apps/web/src/lib/server/db/compute.ts` is
used only for reads and is excluded from web migrations.

The compute service has three restricted runtime roles, provisioned after the
compute and queue migrations by `tsdhn-queue-grants`. None can run schema
changes, and row-level security scopes each to the deployment's queue:

| Role | Process | Queue capability | `compute.jobs` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `COMPUTE_PRODUCER_ROLE` | API | enqueue and read (`PRODUCE`) | `SELECT`, `INSERT` |
| `COMPUTE_WORKER_ROLE` | worker | claim and transition (`CONSUME`) | `SELECT`, `UPDATE` |
| `COMPUTE_PURGER_ROLE` | worker retention | inspect plus delete queue jobs | none |

The producer cannot claim a job, the worker cannot delete one, and the purger
cannot reach `compute.jobs`. Deleting a queue job cascades to its attempt
history, so retention uses its own credential rather than the consumer role.

## Cross-boundary invariants

The queue, compute row, workspace, and retention records describe one
simulation across different storage systems. The following is the invariant
brief for changes to any of them: a transition is authorized only by the
process or maintenance path named below, and a process must not infer safety
from a state in another store unless the stated join or fence also holds.

### Runtime identities and role membership

- The schema-owner connection is authorized for migrations and provisioning
  only. API, worker, and purger startup requires its own configured password
  and must never fall back to the owner URL.
- The API producer may create/read compute rows and enqueue/read queue rows.
  It does not claim, transition, or delete queue work.
- The worker may claim and transition queue rows and read/update
  `compute.jobs`. It cannot insert or delete queue rows.
- The purger may inspect and delete queue rows only through the retention
  policy below. It has no `compute.jobs` privilege.
- Provisioning is narrowing and repeatable: each runtime role is
  `NOSUPERUSER`, `NOCREATEDB`, `NOCREATEROLE`, `NOBYPASSRLS`,
  `NOREPLICATION`, `NOINHERIT`, and has no inherited role membership. A
  manual grant or a template role must not widen a runtime capability.

### Queue state

The producer creates one queue row for a compute job, with a dedupe key and a
payload naming that job. The worker is the only runtime actor that claims a
pending row, renews its lease, and advances it through execution; rqueue's
lease fence makes a superseded attempt's transition fail. Queue finalization
may produce a terminal row without the handler updating `compute.jobs`, which
is why reconciliation exists. The purger may only delete an already-terminal,
old row that also passes the compute-side and payload checks; it never creates,
claims, or updates queue work.

### Compute state

`compute.jobs` is the application record and is never deleted by retention.
The normal status transitions are `queued -> running -> completed` or
`queued -> running -> failed`; an operator retry may re-enter `running` from
`failed`. The worker's progress and failure writes are fenced by
`owner_attempt` and refuse terminal rows. Completion writes carry both fences as
well: a late result from an attempt that was reconciled or otherwise lost its
row is not allowed to overwrite the terminal state. Reconciliation is the
recovery transition for a queue-terminal row whose compute row is still
unfinished: it changes that row to `failed` after the grace period. A completed
row is never reopened by at-least-once queue delivery; only the current owning
attempt may record a result, and only while the row is non-terminal.

### Workspace and lock state

`JOBS_DIR/{simulation_id}` and its sibling `.lock` are one workspace state,
not independent scratch files. An attempt must claim the exclusive `flock`
before reading checkpoints or writing the engine workspace. The claim remains
held through result upload, using separate releases for the kernel thread and
the completion path; a superseded attempt cannot write after the database
fence rejects it. A process crash releases the kernel lock so a replacement
attempt can resume. Only the owning completion path, or the abandoned-work
sweep for an old terminal compute row, may remove the workspace, and removal
must reacquire the lock before unlinking it.

### Purge state

Queue retention is authorized only when all of these facts hold in the same
database policy: the row belongs to this queue, its queue state is terminal,
its `finished_at` is more than seven days old, its payload names a canonical
compute job UUID, and the matching `compute.jobs.status` is `completed` or
`failed`. The database security-definer predicate enforces the cross-schema
status check while keeping `compute.jobs` hidden from the purger. The worker
also preselects candidates through its compute-readable pool, but that
application check is advisory to the database policy, not a privilege
boundary. Missing, malformed, recent, or still-running counterparts remain
available for reconciliation and inspection; `compute.jobs` itself is never
purged.

## Queue retention

Terminal `task_queue.jobs` rows whose matching `compute.jobs` row is also
terminal are deleted after seven days by an hourly pass in the worker process.
Rows whose compute counterpart is still running, missing, or malformed remain
available for reconciliation. The queue row has no application value once the
handler records the outcome; the week preserves attempt history for operational
inspection over a working week and weekend. Attempt and occurrence rows follow
through `ON DELETE CASCADE`. `compute.jobs` is not purged because it holds the
simulation result record.

## Identifiers

| Name | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simulation_id` | web app | Public simulation ID, used again when a submission is retried |
| internal job ID | compute service | Database and queue ID; never returned to the web app |
| output object key | compute service | Private MinIO location |

The public page is `/simulations/{simulation_id}`. The web app creates
`simulation_id` before calling the compute API and uses the same value for
every retry.

Repeating a request with the same `simulation_id` and input returns the
existing compute job. Reusing the ID with different input is rejected. A
researcher can therefore retry after a lost response without starting the
same simulation twice.

## Displayed state

The compute row is the current record once it exists. Before then, the web app
derives a short submission state from its own row:

```text
compute row exists                  use the compute job status
no compute row, submission error    submission_failed
no compute row, no error            submitting
```

A stale submission error never overrides an existing compute row. A successful
retry clears the saved submission error.

Compute jobs use these states:

```text
queued     waiting for a worker
running    executing the simulation
completed  output metadata and files were stored
failed     the simulation cannot continue
```

## Submit a simulation

1. The web app authenticates the user and validates the form.
2. It creates the simulation ID and saves the user input.
3. It sends the ID and input to the compute API.
4. The compute service creates the job and queue task in one database
   transaction, or returns the existing job for the same ID and input.
5. The browser opens the simulation page.

If the request fails before a compute row can be read, the web app saves a
submission error. The researcher can retry with the same `simulation_id`.

## Run a simulation

1. A worker claims the queue task.
2. It marks the compute job as running.
3. It runs the engine in `TSDHN_JOBS_DIR/{simulation_id}`.
4. Progress callbacks update the compute job and notify listeners.
5. The worker uploads completed output files and their metadata to MinIO.
6. It marks the job as completed only after storage succeeds.

## Show progress

The web app checks ownership, then reads the simulation and its compute row.
For live progress, it relays the compute API event stream to the browser. The
compute service sends the current state, listens for PostgreSQL notifications,
and closes the stream when the job finishes or the configured stream lifetime
ends.

## Download an output file

1. The browser asks the web app for an output name.
2. The web app checks the session, simulation ownership, and available names.
3. The compute API creates a short-lived MinIO URL.
4. The browser downloads the file directly from MinIO.

The web app and compute API do not relay output bytes.

## Failure and recovery

The compute service retries temporary failures in PostgreSQL, MinIO, or other
services. Invalid input, missing model files, and failed scientific steps do
not become more likely to succeed when repeated, so they fail the job.

The engine records enough state to continue valid completed work after a
retry. The compute service keeps the job in `compute.jobs` and reports the
final failure when retries are exhausted. Deployment settings determine retry
limits, worker recovery, storage, and cleanup.

A worker asked to stop gracefully stops taking new work and gives what it is
already running a short grace period. A simulation runs far longer than that, so
it is cancelled and its claim is handed straight back for another worker, which
resumes from the checkpoints in the job's work directory.

A worker that dies mid-run loses its lease, and the queue reclaims the job
without asking the dead worker anything. When that happens on the job's last
attempt the queue records the failure by itself, so no running code is left to
update `compute.jobs`. The worker process therefore reconciles: it periodically
finds jobs the queue has finished that `compute.jobs` still shows as running,
and marks them failed with an error saying the status was reconciled rather
than reported by the run. A job that reported its own outcome is never
overwritten.

Because the simulation runs on a thread that the service cannot stop on demand,
a job records which attempt currently owns it, and every write an attempt makes
is accepted only if that attempt still owns the job and the job is not already
finished. A late write from an attempt that has been replaced, or from one whose
job has already been reconciled, is refused rather than applied.

The same reasoning covers the job's working directory, which holds the
checkpoints a retry resumes from. An attempt holds an exclusive claim on that
directory for as long as its simulation is actually running, so a replacement
never reads checkpoints another attempt is still writing. If the worker process
dies the claim is released with it, and the replacement resumes normally; if the
previous attempt is still running, the replacement waits and retries instead.

### Who may change what

Two systems hold state for one simulation, and they are updated by different
actors at different times: the task queue owns delivery, leases and retries,
and `compute.jobs` owns what a researcher sees. Neither can read the other's
mind, so the rules below are what keep them from disagreeing. They are worth
stating exactly, because the failures they prevent are silent ones -- a job
that reads `running` forever, or a finished result quietly overwritten.

The link between the two is `compute.jobs.owner_attempt`: the queue's own
attempt counter for the delivery that currently owns the row. That counter only
ever counts up. Every claim increments it, and an operator retry raises the
attempt ceiling rather than resetting the count, so a larger number always means
a later delivery -- which is what lets a guard tell "the newest attempt" from
"an attempt that has been superseded" without any cross-system locking.

| Transition | Who | Allowed when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queued` (row created, task enqueued) | API request | The job row and its queue entry commit together, so a job always has an entry. |
| `queued`/`running`/`failed` -> `running` (claim) | The attempt that was just delivered | It is not superseded (`owner_attempt` is unset or not newer), the job is not `completed`, and -- if the job is `failed` -- this attempt is **strictly newer** than the one that owns it. |
| progress updates | The running attempt | It still owns the row *and* the row is not already finished. |
| -> `completed` | The running attempt | It still owns the row and the row is not already finished. |
| -> `failed` (reported) | The running attempt | It still owns the row and the row is not already finished. |
| -> `failed` (reconciled) | The worker's periodic reconciliation | The queue has given up on the job, it has been terminal longer than the grace period, the row is not already finished, and no **newer** attempt has taken the row since. |
| restart a finished job | An operator, through the queue's retry API | The job is terminal in the queue. It comes back as a strictly newer attempt and claims the row through the ordinary rule above. |

Two consequences are worth spelling out, because they are the ones that are
easy to get wrong.

**A finished job is never reopened by accident.** `completed` is never
reclaimed at all -- at-least-once delivery means a finished job can be
delivered again, and re-running it would flip a finished row back to `running`
for everyone watching. `failed` may be reclaimed, but only by a strictly newer
attempt, which is exactly an operator retry and never a straggler waking up
after its job was reconciled.

**Reconciliation never overrules a live attempt.** It exists for the case where
nothing is left running to report an outcome, so it skips any row a newer
attempt has since taken, and it records the attempt it failed so a straggler
from that same attempt cannot claim the row afterwards. If it and a retry race,
either order is safe: the retry's claim supersedes a reconciliation that landed
first, and a reconciliation that would land second is skipped.

The working directory follows the same ownership idea with a separate
mechanism, because files are not rows: the claim described above is a lock held
by the operating system, so it is released even when the process holding it dies
without warning.
