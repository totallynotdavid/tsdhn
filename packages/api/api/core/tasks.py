"""Queue tasks for simulation runs and worker maintenance.

Abandoned attempts, and how their writes are fenced
---------------------------------------------------
The simulation kernel is synchronous and runs on a thread via
`asyncio.to_thread`. rqueue cancels a handler's *coroutine* when the heartbeat
discovers the lease is gone (`Worker._heartbeat_loop` -> `handler_task.cancel()`),
but Python cannot kill the thread underneath it. That thread keeps running and
holds a live reference to the event loop through `on_progress`, so it can still
try to write `compute.jobs` for a job another worker has taken over -- or for a
job `reconcile_terminal_jobs` has already, correctly, marked failed.

Procrastinate did not have this exposure: its task was synchronous, with no
background thread able to outlive a cancelled coroutine. It is new here.

The fence is in the database, not in this process. `mark_started` claims the row
for `context.attempt` by writing `compute.jobs.owner_attempt`, and every write
an attempt makes afterwards carries its own attempt number in the *same*
statement as the write (`WHERE id = $1 AND owner_attempt = $n ...`). A write
from a superseded attempt therefore matches zero rows. `record_progress` adds
`AND status <> ALL(TERMINAL_STATUSES)`, because the abandoned attempt is often
still the row's owner -- the case that matters is a stale write flipping a
reconciled `failed` job back to `running`, undoing the repair reconciliation
just made, and only the status predicate catches that.

A refused write is not an error; it is the fence working. `on_progress` treats
one as the signal to stop, raising `AbandonedAttempt` so the kernel unwinds and
the thread ends rather than burning a core on work nobody will read.

That exception surfaces in two different places, and the difference matters:

- **Refused write.** The coroutine is still live and awaiting the thread, so
  `AbandonedAttempt` propagates into `run_simulation_task` as a real exception.
  It is caught there and re-raised as `rqueue.CancelJob`, because standing down
  is not a failure: letting it reach rqueue's generic exception path would
  record a `rqueue.job.failed`, finalize the job as failed, and log two
  tracebacks for a fence working correctly -- and an on-call engineer would
  have no way to tell that from a simulation that actually broke.
- **Cancellation.** rqueue has already cancelled the coroutine, so there is
  nothing left to propagate into and the thread just ends. The same `abandoned`
  flag is set directly there, which usually stops the thread a step *earlier*
  than a refused write would.

The workspace is fenced separately, and has to be
-------------------------------------------------
The database fence protects `compute.jobs`. It does nothing for the *files*:
the workspace is keyed by simulation id, not by attempt, and an abandoned
thread mid-step keeps writing checkpoints into it. A replacement attempt that
resumed from a half-written checkpoint would produce a wrong scientific result
rather than an error, which is worse than any status confusion.

`claim_workspace` therefore takes an exclusive `flock` on a lock file beside the
workspace. A second attempt is refused while a live owner holds it -- including
from another thread of the same process -- and gets `TransientInfraError`, so
rqueue's backoff waits for the abandoned thread to unwind rather than racing it.
When the holding *process* dies the kernel drops the lock, so an ordinary worker
crash still leaves the workspace resumable.

The claim spans more than the kernel. `complete_job` reads the result files back
out of the same directory to upload them, after the kernel thread has returned,
so a claim that ended with the kernel would leave that upload unprotected --
the identical corruption a few lines later. The claim therefore carries two
shares, one given back by the kernel thread and one by this coroutine after the
upload, and the descriptor closes only when both have. Neither holder can be
cancelled, and a cancelled coroutine ends while the thread is still writing, so
"whoever finishes last closes it" is the only rule that works.

`remove_workspace` takes the lock before it removes anything, for the same
reason in reverse: `unlink` on a locked file drops the directory entry while the
holder keeps its lock on the orphaned inode, so the next `O_CREAT` at that path
creates a *new* inode that locks uncontended. It refuses rather than forces, and
the next sweep retries.

Two limits are worth knowing. A thread that never reaches another progress
callback holds the workspace until it finishes on its own, and the replacement
can exhaust its attempts waiting -- a visible, bounded failure rather than
silent corruption, which is the trade being made. And `flock` is a
single-machine primitive: two workers on different hosts sharing one network
volume are not protected by it. Neither the compose deployment (one worker, a
local volume) nor any current configuration is exposed to the second.
