    `queue_schema` is interpolated rather than bound because PostgreSQL has no
    bind parameter for an identifier. The only value ever passed is
    `rqueue.Queue.schema`, which rqueue validated against
    `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*` when the queue was constructed, so the interpolated
    name is byte-identical to the schema rqueue itself created.

    The `MATERIALIZED` CTE is load bearing, not stylistic. Casting
    `payload->>'compute_job_id'` to uuid *aborts the whole statement* on one
    malformed value -- `SELECT ('{{"compute_job_id":"x"}}'::jsonb->>
    'compute_job_id')::uuid` raises `invalid input syntax for type uuid` --
    so a single bad row would silently un-reconcile every other stuck job in
    the pass. Filtering with a regex in the same `WHERE` as the cast does not
    fix that: PostgreSQL is free to evaluate the qualifiers in either order.
    Putting the cast in a materialized CTE's select list, behind the regex in
    that CTE's `WHERE`, does: the projection is computed only for rows that
    passed the filter, and `MATERIALIZED` stops the planner from folding the
    two levels back together. A payload this codebase did not write is skipped
    rather than fatal.

    That snapshot is also the one hazard the CTE creates, and the
    `j.owner_attempt <= q.attempt` predicate is what answers it. `gave_up` is
    read once, at statement start; nothing re-reads the queue afterwards. The
    `UPDATE` that follows can then block for as long as a concurrent
    `mark_started` holds the compute row's lock -- and in that window an
    operator retry can put the queue row back to `pending`, a worker can claim
    it, and that live attempt can take ownership of the compute row. The
    snapshot still says `failed` at the older attempt, so without this
    predicate the pass would mark a *running, rightfully owned* job failed,
    and the live attempt's own `complete_job` would then be refused by the
    terminal-status guard: a job killed by the pass meant to repair jobs.

    Re-reading the queue row is one way to close that. Comparing
    `owner_attempt` is better, and cheaper: it takes no lock on rqueue's own
    table, and it tests the thing that actually decides the question -- who
    owns the compute row *now*. PostgreSQL re-evaluates an `UPDATE`'s
    qualifiers against the latest committed row version when it unblocks
    (`READ COMMITTED` / EvalPlanQual), so `j.owner_attempt` here is the value
    the concurrent `mark_started` just committed, not the one from the
    snapshot. A newer owner means a newer attempt, and the row is skipped.

    The reverse order needs no help from this predicate: if the pass wins the
    lock first, it marks the row failed at the older attempt, and the live
    attempt's `mark_started` then reclaims it under the strictly-newer rule.
    Either way the live attempt survives, which is why no lock is needed.

    Nothing gets stranded by this, because `owner_attempt` can never outrun the
    queue: it is only ever written from `context.attempt`, which *is* the queue's
    counter for that delivery, or by this pass from `q.attempt`. Once a queue
    row settles terminal at its final attempt, the compute row's owner is at
    most that number, so a later pass always matches.

    write ever happening -- a worker whose lease expired with its attempt
    budget spent, which rqueue fails by a pure SQL update that never calls the
    handler; a failure inside `complete_job` after the kernel finished; a
    second outage that defeats `record_failure` itself. In every one of them
    the queue row is terminal while compute.jobs is still `running`, and
    without this pass nothing would ever correct it.

    Only rows the queue gave up on and that compute.jobs has not already
    finished are touched, so running this twice, or from two workers at once,
    changes nothing the first pass did not: the guard is evaluated under the
    row lock the UPDATE takes.

    The pass also stamps `owner_attempt` with the queue's own attempt counter,
    and that is what makes the repair stick. Without it, the attempt this pass
    just failed *on the queue's behalf* is still free to come back: a worker
    wedged past its lease can reach `mark_started` afterwards and reopen the
    row (`owner_attempt IS NULL` when it never got that far, or equal to its
    own number when it did), leaving compute.jobs `running` under a queue row
    that says `failed`. Recording which attempt the queue gave up on turns
    "has this job been reconciled?" into a comparison `mark_started` can make:
    only a strictly newer attempt may reclaim a failed row, and rqueue's
    attempt counter only ever counts up (`storage.lease_jobs` does
    `attempt = attempt + 1` on every claim, and `Admin.retry_job` deliberately
    does not reset it -- it raises `max_attempts` instead), so an operator
    retry always is strictly newer and a stale attempt never is.

    `GREATEST(COALESCE(...), ...)` because the two counters can legitimately

    Three things happen in one statement, and all three have to: taking
    ownership, refusing to reopen a finished job, and marking the job running.
    A claim is lost when a *newer* attempt already owns the row, or when the
    job is already `completed` -- at-least-once delivery means a completed job
    can come back, and re-running it would flip a finished row to `running` for
    everyone watching.

    `completed` is refused outright. `failed` is refused only for an attempt
    that is not strictly newer than the one that owns the row, because the two
    ways a job gets there need opposite answers:

    - `rqueue.Admin.retry_job` is the documented way an operator restarts a
      terminally failed job, and it works by putting the same row back to
      `pending` for an ordinary claim. If a `failed` compute row could not be
      reclaimed at all, that retry would run a whole simulation whose every
      write was rejected.
    - `reconcile_terminal_jobs` marks a row failed on behalf of a queue that
      gave up on it, and stamps `owner_attempt` with the attempt it failed.
      The attempt behind that -- a worker wedged past its own lease -- can wake
      up afterwards and reach here, and reopening the row would flip
      compute.jobs to `running` under a queue row that says `failed`, undoing
      the repair and leaving the two systems disagreeing with nothing left to
      correct them.

    Strict inequality separates them exactly, because rqueue's attempt counter
    only ever counts up: `storage.lease_jobs` does `attempt = attempt + 1` on
    every claim, and `retry_terminal` deliberately does not reset it (attempt
    records are immutable and keyed by `(job_id, attempt)`; a fresh budget
    comes from raising `max_attempts`). So an operator retry is always strictly
    newer than the reconciled attempt, and the wedged attempt never is.

    A reclaimed row also has its previous attempt's `error` and `finished_at`
    cleared. That is not cosmetic: `status_from_row` hands both to the status
    endpoint and to SSE beside the new `running`, so leaving them makes a live
    run indistinguishable from a stale failure to every client.

    Fenced on `owner_attempt` *and* on the row not already being terminal,
    like every other write an attempt makes. The attempt fence alone is not
    enough here, for the same reason it is not enough in `record_progress`:
    the attempt that gets reconciled is still the row's owner afterwards. A
    worker wedged past its lease, whose attempt budget the queue then spent,
    has its job failed by `reconcile_terminal_jobs` while its kernel thread is
    still running; when that kernel finally returns, `owner_attempt` still
    matches, and without the status guard this would flip the row to
    `completed` under a queue row that says `failed` -- the one divergence
    reconciliation exists to prevent, reintroduced at the last step.

    Standing down costs a real result, which is why the refusal is loud (see
    below) rather than silent: the objects are in MinIO and the log says where.
    Recording it instead would be worse, because the two systems would then
    disagree permanently with nothing left to reconcile them.

    Returns whether the manifest landed. It matters here more than anywhere
    else that the caller can tell: the upload has already happened by the time
    the UPDATE runs, so a silently skipped write leaves objects in MinIO with
    nothing in `compute.jobs` pointing at them, and no trace of why.
